| Aspect of Full SBB | How will this aspect be implemented? |
|---|---|
| Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2 | Our school will provide Secondary 2 students the opportunity to take Humanities subjects at a more demanding level, if they meet subject-specific criteria.<br><br>This is applicable to students who are in the Secondary 2 Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) course from 2022.<br><br><br>Eligible students from the 2021 Secondary 1 Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) cohorts who are promoted to the same course in 2022 will be able to offer Geography at a more demanding level. With this increased flexibility in customising our students’ learning experiences, we are better able to recognise their strengths and nurture their intrinsic motivation to learn.<br><br>Students who wish to be considered to offer Geography at a more demanding level will have to meet subject-specific criteria in Secondary 1. They should also possess a positive attitude towards learning and a strong commitment to offer the subject at a more demanding level. |
| Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum | As part of the Full SBB, our school will implement mixed form classes at Secondary 1.<br><br>This is applicable to Secondary 1 students entering our school in 2022.<br><br><br>The 2022 cohort of Secondary 1 students will be grouped in mixed form classes, comprising students from different courses of study. Students will attend lessons in the form classes for the following subjects: Character and Citizenship Education, Music, Physical Education, Art, Design &amp; Technology, as well as Food and Consumer Education.<br><br>For the academic subjects, namely English, Mother Tongue Language, Mathematics, Science, and the Humanities, students will be attending lessons based on their subject classes. The subject classes will be organised based on their respective course levels [N(T), N(A) or Express].<br><br>The common learning experience through the mixed form classes creates a valuable setting for students to mingle, build meaningful friendships, and appreciate different perspectives. It can also help reduce the inadvertent labelling associated with streaming. |
