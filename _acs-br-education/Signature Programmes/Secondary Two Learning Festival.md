### **Secondary Two Learning Festival**
The Secondary 2 Learning Festival (S2LF) is a signature event for Secondary 2 students of ACS (Barker Road). The festival gives students the opportunity to explore their interests, try new things outside of the structured curriculum, and discover more about themselves. Students do this by participating in various programmes that comprise the S2LF, including: Science and Technology Programme, Aesthetics Exploration Programme, Sports Exposure Programme, Career Exploration Programme, and In-house Courses run by our own ACS (Barker Road) teachers.

The objectives of the festival are to:

*   provide students time and a safe environment to discover their interests and talents through authentic exploration;
*   cultivate a reflective behaviour that nurtures a growth mindset.
