### **Spiritual and Moral**
Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road) offers an education that holds true to Bishop Oldham’s vision of philosophy of education that stresses Academic Achievements, Strength of Character and Christian Service. We believe that God is our Strength and Provider, and that by His Grace, students come to us for a purpose - to have their lives touched and changed.

The school aims to provide a holistic education for all, where values are inculcated. There are two traditions that have been handed down through all our Methodist Schools that assist our educational mission to build and shape character:

First, the weekly Chapel programme which is an integral part of the life of the school, where all staff and students will attend. Second, a brief “Thought for the Day” based on the Bible, followed by a short prayer which will be delivered everyday.
