### **ACS Heritage**
#### **School Crest**

**Shield Shape**<br>
<img src="/images/crest2.png" style="width:30%;margin-left:15px;" align = "right">
The ACS Crest is shaped as a shield to uphold knightly values such as chivalry, honour, valour, loyalty and manliness. The letters ‘ACS’, besides being the initials of the school’s name, also spell Academic Achievements, Strength of Character and Christian Service. The crest was designed in 1930 by the late Dr. Yap Pheng Geck who was then a member of the staff.

**Composite Creature**<br>
The upper part of the crest shows a creature with a lion head, eagle wings and a dragon body with claws, representing the fact that the School was founded when Singapore was a British colony, by the American Methodist Mission and during the Manchu dynasty in China.

**Blue and Gold Panels**<br>
The lower part of the ACS Crest comprises a panel of blue and another of gold, representing the heavens and the earth, superimposed on which are the letters ACS in red, signifying life bridging earth and heaven.

#### **ACS Anthem**
In days of yore from western shores<br>
Oldham dauntless hero came<br>
and planted a Beacon of Truth and Light<br>
in this island of the Main.<br>
Here may it stand from year to year<br>
emblem of grand endeavour<br>
The regions round echo the sound
of A.C.S. forever.<br>

(Chorus)<br>
Sing A.C.S. forevermore,<br>
our A.C.S. forever.<br>
God save our land and heaven bless<br>
our A.C.S. forever.<br>

Our students hail from China's plains<br>
and the Land of Rising Sun.<br>
We have many sons from India's strand<br>
and the islands of the Main.<br>
Our hearts our hopes our aims are one.<br>
No discord e'er will sever.<br>
We'll stand together for the cause<br>
of A.C.S. forever.<br>

(Chorus again)
Sing A.C.S. forevermore,<br>
our A.C.S. forever.<br>
God save our land and heaven bless<br>
our A.C.S. forever.<br>
