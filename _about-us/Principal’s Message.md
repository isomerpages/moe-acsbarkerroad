### **Principal’s Message**
#### **3 Senses and 4 Honours**

Someone once asked me what I would want Singapore to be like for my grandchildren. This was in the context of setting strategic directions. At first, I thought the question was strange because when thinking of strategic directions, especially for schools, most Principals would think of the current generation of students and how we can better prepare them for their future. However, upon deeper reflection, I realized why the question is so important. Thinking about the Singapore I want for my grandchildren means that I have to think not just about the future readiness of this generation of students but their capability, as adults and contributing citizens, to create the Singapore that they want for their children. The question forced me to think not just about the success of the current generation of students in future but also their ability to create a nation where their children and grandchildren will also find success and significance in a virtuous cycle. In other words, what it means to nurture **_generations_** _of educated men who are God-fearing and growing in Grace_. It is a source of great encouragement to know that I stand on the shoulders of those who have gone before me tapping on the rich heritage of faithfulness of more than 130 years of ACS history.

So what does it mean for our gentlemen to be ‘God-fearing and growing in Grace’? I believe it is best described by three ‘Senses’ and four ‘Honours’.
