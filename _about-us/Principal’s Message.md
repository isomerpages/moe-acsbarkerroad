### **Principal’s Message**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A warm welcome to Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road)! We will be celebrating our 140th Founder’s Day in 2026.  This speaks volumes of our rich heritage and history of nurturing ‘generations of educated men who are God-fearing and growing in grace.’  This vision is ageless and even more relevant in this age of VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity) and BANI (Brittle, Anxious, Non-linear, Incomprehensible) times. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
How does an educated man look like? It is as described in our student’s creed – ‘I shall learn to sharpen my mind, stretch my intellect, and learn to love learning.’ Here at ACS(BR), we want to train our gentlemen to have quality thinking so that they can discern truth from falsehood, reflect critically and innovate creatively. We also want our gentlemen ‘to learn about life and how (they) should develop (their) talents’. We design the learning experiences, be it within or beyond the class, with the intention for our gentlemen to learn about life and their potential, talents and gifts they have within.  Hence, we take all aspects of school experiences, including Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) seriously. When these learning experiences are well thought through and implemented, we will achieve the purpose of helping our gentlemen to learn about life and develop their talents. Through this, they will love and enjoy learning, and continue to learn even when they have graduated from formal education.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To what end do we want them to learn about life and develop their talents? It is with the purpose of wanting ‘to serve my God, my country, and my school’. This is the sense of purpose we want our gentlemen to graduate with and live by. We want our gentlemen to steward their lives, talents and leaderships to serve others. They will steward their intellect, empathy and gifts to create value for Singapore, community and the school. They will connect with people of all sectors for the common good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For that to happen, we then need to inculcate in them values that will help them achieve this end. These values include Commitment and Excellence in our R.I.C.E. values. They will Respect all people and live a life of Integrity, where their good works reflect their hearts and their love for God and others. We also need them to demonstrate resilience and hope in the face of challenges, as stated beautifully in the last paragraph of our Student’s Creed, ‘I shall endeavour to give my best in every trial and weather each storm that life throws at me with Faith in God, Hope in my heart and Love for one another.’
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
All these are anchored on our belief that “we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things He planned for us long ago.” (Ephesians 2:10)
</p>
To God be the Glory.

The Best is Yet to Be!
