#### **Personal Learning Device (Chromebook) Purchase** #####
----------------------------------------------------

**Hardware**

Since 2016, students in the school have been using [chromebooks](https://www.google.com/chromebook/) for 1:1 Learning. From 2021, the school started leveraging the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) and MOE Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) to facilitate the chromebook personal learning device (PLD) procurement process. For the 2025 Secondary 1 cohort, the school has evaluated the given options from a panel of awarded suppliers established by MOE and chosen the **Acer Chromebook Spin R857TN**. The specifications of the chromebook are as follows:

Acer Chromebook Spin R857TN

In addition, the chromebook will be bundled with **3 years carry-in warranty and insurance** (2 major repairs or 1 replacement) to cover accidental damage to the chromebook device.

Total Cost with GST: **S$570.00**
*(Information accurate as of 17th December 2024. This cost is a close estimation and there may be a slight variation for the final confirmed cost.)*

**IT Applications**

The school will also progressively roll out IT applications that will be vital for students’ teaching and learning. These include: 
*	Student iCON: Every secondary school student will be provided with access to the Google Suite set of tools, including email address.
*	Microsoft Office 365: Every secondary school student will be able to use Microsoft Office tools that include Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.

The school will need to use your child’s/ward’s full name, Student iCON ID and class to set up user accounts. Schools may also choose to roll out applications other than those listed above.

**Device Management App (DMA)**

A Device Management App (DMA) will come pre-installed on all PLDs purchased through the school and will be installed on any student-owned chromebook parents/guardians opt for the student to use in lieu of the PLD. The DMA is fully funded by MOE.

The DMA has 3 main components which will support the use of the PLD in the classroom and safeguard students’ cyber wellness: 
*  Classroom Management Service. To help teachers manage students’ use of the PLD during lesson time to improve classroom management and support effective teaching and learning.
*  Mobile Device Management Service. To help update and manage the PLD, protect the PLD from malicious software, and protects students from objectionable internet content.
*  Usage Management Service. To enable school and/or parents/guardians to better supervise and set helpful limits for students’ use of PLD after school.

**Procurement**

Students who are Singapore citizens can use their Edusave to pay fully or partly for the PLD, after setting aside provision for payment of miscellaneous fees. Parents/Guardians can also choose to pay cash for the PLD. MOE has provided Edusave top-ups of $200 in 2020 to 2022, and $300 in 2023 to all eligible Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools. This is on top of the annual Edusave contribution of $290 for secondary school students and $230 for primary school students.

Subsidies are available for students who require funding support to purchase a PLD. Please note that it is compulsory for all students on the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) to use their Edusave to pay for any remaining sums due for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted. Please see the table below for information on the eligibility for the subsidy:



| Students eligible for subsidy | Income criteria | How to Apply for Subsidy |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Students under MOE FAS | Gross Household Income (“GHI”) is $3,000 or less, or Per Capita Income (“PCI”)* is $750 or less | No action required. Automatically subsidised for the PLD.    |
| Students under School-based FAS | GHI is $4,400 or less, or PCI is $1,100 or less | Approach the school’s General Office to apply for a subsidy. |
 | Students who are currently not under the MOE FAS or School-based FAS | GHI is $4,400 or less, or PCI is $1,100 or less | Approach the school’s General Office to apply for a subsidy. |

*PCI refers to the GHI divided by the total number of family members in the household.*




To proceed with the purchase, please fill in the online form at this link: **[https://go.gov.sg/pdlpadmin](https://go.gov.sg/pdlpadmin)** (Singpass to access) by 15 Jan 2025.

If you are unable to submit the form online, please contact the school for a hardcopy version.


**Payment**

Each student would receive a personalised bill subsequently later in February/March 2025.

For parents who have chose to pay by cash and are already on GIRO with MOE, the system will auto-deduct the charges from their GIRO account directly and they will not be required to pay cash or cheque.

For those parents who are not on GIRO, the school bill will indicate the outstanding amount which they will need to pay in either cash/cheque to the school or through AXS.
