#### **Family@Barker Parent Support Group (PSG)**
----------
Family@Barker (F@B) is a dynamic community of parent volunteers (PVs) who work closely with our school to enrich and support the school's programmes. We are committed to providing parents with meaningful opportunities to connect, share experiences, and support each other throughout your sons’ secondary school years, as they navigate the challenges of growing into young adults and preparing for their national exams.

**WhatsApp chat group**

To help keep you informed and connected, Family@Barker (F@B) has set up a dedicated ACS(BR) Sec 1 2025 Parents WhatsApp chat group. You can join by scanning the QR code below or by visiting [https://bit.ly/3BdijgN](https://bit.ly/3BdijgN).

This chat group will enable you to:
* Express interest in becoming a parent volunteer (PV) with F@B.
* Receive important PSG announcements and updates.
* Join the official ACS(BR) Sec 1 level and class WhatsApp groups.
