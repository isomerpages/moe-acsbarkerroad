The MethodistWalk is a biennial fundraising activity organised by the Methodist Schoolsâ€™ Foundation (MSF), on behalf of the Methodist schools in Singapore. Traditionally, on the last Saturday in March, student representatives from all 15 Methodist schools gather with teachers, family members and supporters from the Methodist churches, to walk together and raise money for the needs of individual schools. In this edition of the MethodistWalk, we have pledged to collectively walk 1,000,000 km from 1 March 2023 to 25 March 2023 and to collectively raise $1,000,000.

Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road) will be raising money to help fund the various school programmes to provide the holistic education we want for our young gentlemen as well as for renovation and improvement to our school facilities. Our fundraising goal is $100,000.
