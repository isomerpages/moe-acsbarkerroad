<p><strong>Recess Timing and Snack Break</strong>

am daily.</p>
<p>They will have a 5-min snack break in class at 1 pm daily, except for
Thursdays and Fridays which are shorter days. The intent of the snack break
is to allow students to have a light snack that can provide them with an
energy boost and help them to be better focused in class. The snack should
be small, healthy, and easily consumed within 5 minutes, without leaving
a mess.</p>

<h4><strong>Chromebooks (Personal Learning Devices)</strong></h4>
<hr>
<p>The school has been on the 1:1 Learning (1 student to 1 computing device)
programme since 2012 where ICT is closely integrated into the students’
core and co-curriculums. Within the academic domain, students use their
computing devices for collaborating, research and creating artefacts of
their learning. On the character front, students are also challenged to
think about their values in making responsible decisions while using technology.
Students in Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road) have been using chromebooks
as their Personal Learning Device for 1:1 Learning since 2016 and the school
will leverage on the MOE Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP)
to facilitate the chromebook procurement process.</p>
<p>Your son is required to purchase a chromebook for 1:1 Learning. More details
will be provided during the Meet-The-Parent session on 8 Jan. You can also
refer to this <a href="/admissions/2026-sec-1-registration/11learning/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">page</a> and
this <a href="https://go.gov.sg/acsbr-chromebook-faq" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> for
more information.</p>
<p>1:1 Learning for the Sec 1s is scheduled to commence from Term 2 and students
should bring their chromebooks to school daily for their learning.</p>
<p>Once again, we want to welcome you to ACS (Barker Road) . The next few
years will be a time of growing and development for our young men. It will
be interesting and exciting as we see each become an ACS Gentleman, for
we know that The Best Is Yet To Be!</p>
