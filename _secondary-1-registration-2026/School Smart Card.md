All students entering Secondary One in Jan 2026 will be issued with a new Secondary level School Smart Cards (SSC).

While awaiting for the SSCs to be ready, students can continue to use their Primary level SSCs for concessionary travel till end Apr 2026.

Students can still purchase the Bus Concession Pass(BCP) using their Primary level SSCs but they would need to purchase the BCP for Secondary School students.
