<h4><strong>Personal Learning Device (Chromebook) Purchase</strong></h4>
<hr>
<p><strong>Hardware</strong>
</p>
<p>Since 2016, students in the school have been using <a href="https://www.google.com/chromebook/discover-chromebook/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Chromebooks</a> as
their Personal Learning Device (PLD) for <a href="https://www.acsbr.moe.edu.sg/education/academic/1-to-1-learning/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">1:1 Learning</a>.
From 2021, the school has been leveraging MOE's Personalised Digital Learning
Programme (PDLP) to facilitate the PLD procurement process. The PLD will
be used with the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) and other educational
technology to personalise and enhance students' learning. For the 2026
Secondary 1 cohort, the school has chosen the <strong>Acer Chromebook Spin R857TN</strong> from
MOE's panel of awarded suppliers. The specifications of the Chromebook
are as follows:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Model: Chromebook Spin R857TN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Processor: Intel Processor N250</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory (size, type, speed): 8GB LPDDR5X 4800MT/s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Storage (type and size): 64GB eMMC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced Bundle Warranty: 4-Year Carry-in Warranty</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhanced Bundle Insurance: 4-Year Insurance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weight: 1.5 kg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accessories include: Power Adaptor, Mouse, Active stylus, Carrier Bag</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The chromebook will be bundled with&nbsp;<strong>4 years carry-in warranty and insurance</strong>&nbsp;(2
major repairs or 1 replacement)&nbsp;to cover accidental damage to the
chromebook device.</p>
<p>Total Cost with GST:&nbsp;<strong>S$632.20 </strong><em>(Information accurate as of 27th Nov 2025. This cost is a close estimation and there may be a slight variation for the final confirmed cost.)</em>
</p>
<p><strong>IT Applications</strong>
</p>
<p>The school will also progressively roll out IT applications that will
be vital for students’ teaching and learning. These include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Student iCON: Every secondary school student will be provided with access
to the Google Suite set of tools, including email address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Microsoft Office 365: Every secondary school student will be able to use
Microsoft Office tools that include Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The school will need to use your child’s/ward’s full name, Student iCON
ID and class to set up user accounts. Schools may also choose to roll out
applications other than those listed above.</p>
<p><strong>Device Management App (DMA)</strong>
</p>
<p>A Device Management App (DMA) will come pre-installed on all chromebook
PLDs purchased through the school and will be installed on any student-owned
chromebook parents/guardians opt for the student to use. The DMA is fully
funded by MOE.</p>
<p>The DMA has 3 main components which will support the use of the PLD in
the classroom and safeguard students’ cyber wellness:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Classroom Management Service. To help teachers manage students’ use of
the PLD during lesson time to improve classroom management and support
effective teaching and learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mobile Device Management Service. To help update and manage the PLD, protect
the PLD from malicious software, and protects students from objectionable
internet content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usage Management Service. To enable school and/or parents/guardians to
better supervise and set helpful limits for students’ use of PLD after
school.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Procurement</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who are Singapore citizens can use their Edusave to pay fully
or partly for the PLD, after setting aside provision for payment of miscellaneous
fees. Parents/Guardians can also choose to pay cash for the PLD. MOE has
provided Edusave top-ups from 2020 to 2023 to all eligible Singaporean
students&nbsp;in primary and secondary schools. In 2025, MOE has provided
a $500 Edusave top-up for students aged 13-16 years old. This is on top
of the annual Edusave contribution of $290 for secondary school students
and $230 for primary school students.</p>
<p>Subsidies are available for students who require funding support to purchase
a PLD. Please note that it is compulsory for all students on the MOE Financial
Assistance Scheme (FAS) to use their Edusave to pay for any remaining sums
due for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted. Please see the table
below for information on the eligibility for the subsidy:</p>

<p>As far as possible, students are to keep to the stipulated date/timing
for the ICT induction. In the event that students are unable to attend
any stipulated session (due to CCA or any valid reasons), they can join
any session that are planned for other classes or the makeup session. Please
email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:acsbr_it@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">acsbr_it@moe.edu.sg</a>&nbsp;to
inform them about the change. Students should bring their writing materials
for the induction. They do&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;need to bring their own computing
devices. School laptops will be provided for the induction.</p>
