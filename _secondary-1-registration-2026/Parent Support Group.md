<h4><strong>Family@Barker Parent Support Group (PSG)</strong></h4>
<hr>
<p>Family@Barker (F@B) is a dynamic community of parent volunteers (PVs)
who work closely with our school to enrich and support the school's programmes.
We are committed to providing parents with meaningful opportunities to
connect, share experiences, and support each other throughout your sons’
secondary school years, as they navigate the challenges of growing into
young adults and preparing for their national exams.</p>
