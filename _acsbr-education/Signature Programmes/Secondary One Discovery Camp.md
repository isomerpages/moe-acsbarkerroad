### **Secondary One Discovery Camp**
As part of the ACS (Barker Road) Outdoor Experiential Programme, all Secondary 1 students will undergo a 4D3N Discovery Camp.

The Secondary 1 Discovery Camp facilitates participants to learn and bond with their classmates through outdoor activities. The outdoors provide richness and complexity of experiences, such as working with their peers to overcome challenges or navigating in a new environment. This allows students to extend and deepen their learning from the classroom into real life.
