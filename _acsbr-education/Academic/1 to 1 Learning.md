### **1-to-1 Learning**
Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road) has been one of the pioneers in using technology to enhance students’ learning. Back in the early 2010s, the school recognised the need to engage a new generation of learners with strong 21st century competencies and thinking skills. In 2012, the school implemented 1-to-1 Learning (1 student to 1 computing device) with ICT as an empowering tool that is closely integrated into the students’ core and co-curriculums. Within the academic domain, students are conversant in using their computing devices for collaborating, research and creating artefacts of their learning. On the character front, students are also challenged to think about their values in making responsible decisions while using technology. This is aligned to our school’s vision “Generations of educated men who are God-fearing and growing in Grace.” and mission “Touch Hearts, Empower Minds & Enrich Souls”. Since 2016, students in Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road) have been using chromebooks as their Personal Learning Device (PLD) for 1-to-1 Learning.

At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021. Given that the school has been on 1-to-1 Learning for the past decade, it was a seamless transition for the school and the students to PDLP.
