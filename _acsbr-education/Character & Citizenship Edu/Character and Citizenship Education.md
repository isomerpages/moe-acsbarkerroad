### **Character and Citizenship Education**
Through Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), we hope to raise up generations of educated men who are God-fearing and growing in grace. Our gentlemen have the opportunity to partake in a holistic curriculum which develops their character, social-emotional well-being and citizenship dispositions, with avenues to explore their interests beyond the curriculum through Key Student Development Experiences (SDEs), in line with the three senses and four honours. While the pandemic has posed some challenges in the implementation of programmes, it has provided great opportunities for our gentlemen to learn flexibility and be creative.

Here are some highlights of CCE at ACS (BR):

The Secondary 2 students took part in the ‘Love My School Environment’ VIA activity, where they stayed back after school to clean up the campus and caught a glimpse of the daily workload of the school custodial team. The Student Peer Supporter of each class also interviewed school custodians to better understand their daily life, their best memories working in the school and what they hope the students could do more of to make their days better and the class would prepare social media posts featuring the custodians interviewed. The posts would encourage the school population to do their part to make the school environment conducive for learning and appreciate various members of the school, especially our custodians.

CNY celebration in ACS (BR) is always about looking out for the needs in our community. Each class prepared hampers for the retired teachers from the ACS family, the seniors in the Methodist Welfare Services Senior Activity Centres, migrant workers at Sungei Tengah Lodge and our own school custodians and security team. These hampers were then delivered to our beneficiaries with the help of our teachers, parent volunteers and partners.

Our Secondary Two gentlemen embarked on the Cohort Learning Journey to the National Museum of Singapore and took part in the Museum's _Artefactually Speaking_ programme. They had the opportunity to explore the Museum galleries, explored various artefacts, and discovered fascinating stories from their interaction with the Museum Educators.
