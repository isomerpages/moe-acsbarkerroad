#### **Chromebook Purchase** #####

**Hardware**

----------------------------------------------------
Since 2016, students in the school have been using&nbsp;[chromebooks](https://www.google.com/chromebook/)&nbsp;for 1:1 Learning. From 2021, the school will leverage the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) and MOE Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) to facilitate the chromebook procurement process. The school has evaluated the given options and chosen the&nbsp;**Lenovo 500e Chromebook Convertible**&nbsp;for the 2021 Sec 1 cohort. The specifications of the chromebook are as follows:

*   Accessories include: USB Mouse, Notebook Carrying Case, Power Adapter and Lenovo Pen
    

In addition, the chromebook will be bundled with&nbsp;**3 years carry-in warranty and insurance**&nbsp;(\*2 repairs or 1 replacement)&nbsp;to cover accidental damage to the chromebook device.

Total Cost with GST:&nbsp;**S$518.95**

For those students who have placed purchases before February, the chromebooks will be delivered on 28th April 2021.

**Software**


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All the students' chromebooks are to be installed with the Device Management Application (DMA) which comprise of

*  Chrome Device Management (CDM) License and
*  Chromebook Management Application, e.g. Mobile Guardian.
    

The CDM license will allow MOE and the school to centrally manage and monitor the students' usage of the chromebook. The management application is a security app that will further keep the students safe and minimise harmful internet content and distraction. Do note that the school has deployed a "Block All Except Whitelisted" policy on all chromebooks.

**Procurement**


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Singapore Citizens

Students who are Singaporean citizens are allowed to draw on their Edusave Pupils Fund (EPF) to procure the chromebook bundle. This will minimise the cash out-of-pocket for parents. A one-time EPF top-up of $200 has been provided to all Primary and Secondary students in Apr 2020. This is on top of the annual contribution of $290 for Secondary students. Parents/guardians can also choose to pay cash for the chromebook bundle.

Subsidies will be provided for MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) students and those from lower income families. Please note that it is compulsory for all existing students on the MOE FAS to use their Edusave to pay for the chromebook bundle, after subsidies have been granted.

To proceed with the purchase, please fill in the online form at this link:&nbsp;[**https://go.gov.sg/pdlpadmin**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.gov.sg%2Fpdlpadmin&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw3VIflBwyK7tkU69jw0p6PB)&nbsp;(Singpass to access). The online form will consist:

*   Intent to Purchase. For parents/guardians to indicate intent to purchase PLD.
*   Use of Edusave (for Singapore Citizens only). For parents/guardians who have opted to use their child’s/ward’s Edusave to pay for the PLD bundle.
*   Collection of PLD (if purchasing). For parents/guardians to authorise their child/ward or an adult to collect the device on their behalf. You may appoint your child/ward to collect the PLD as the Vendor will run through a device checklist with the students at the point of collection to ensure that the device is in good working condition.
    

If you are unable to submit the form online, you can print the hardcopy version (**Annexes A to C**&nbsp;are appended below) and submit them to the school’s General Office.

  

Permanent Residents/International Students

Subsidies will be provided for students from lower income families.

Fill up hardcopy&nbsp;**Annex A: Intent to Purchase**&nbsp;form and submit to admin office.

Parents could submit the&nbsp;**Annex C: Authorisation**&nbsp;Form if you would like to appoint your child/ward to collect his/her device personally

**Annexes A, B and C - for parents/guardians without Singpass access**

**Payment**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each student would receive a personalised bill subsequently in Feb 2021.

For parents who have chose to pay by cash and are already on GIRO with MOE, the system will auto-deduct the charges from their GIRO account directly and they will not be required to pay cash or cheque.

For those parents who are not on GIRO, the school bill will indicate the outstanding amount which they will need to pay in either cash/cheque to the school or through AXS.

#### **ICT Induction** ####

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All Sec 1 students are to attend a&nbsp;**compulsory**&nbsp;ICT induction session. Purpose of the session is to introduce them to the use of the school Gmail account and NTRIX. The induction will be conducted after school from&nbsp;**3 pm to 3:45 pm**&nbsp;at the&nbsp;**Computer Lab (Academic Block Level 3)**. Please refer to the schedule listed below for the stipulated dates/timing for each Sec 1 class.

_Induction session for 29 Jan (Fri) will take place from 2 pm to 2:45 pm instead._

As far as possible, students are to keep to the stipulated date/timing for the ICT induction. In the event that students are unable to attend any stipulated session (due to Academic Coaching, CCA or whatever reason), they can join any session that are planned for other classes. Do email&nbsp;[it\_helpdesk@acsbr.org](mailto:it_helpdesk@acsbr.org)&nbsp;to inform them about the change. Students should bring their students' handbook and a pen for the induction. They do&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;need to bring their own computing devices. School laptops will be provided for the induction. Students from 1M do not need to stay back as their induction will be conducted during their CPA lessons.

Please email Mr Toh Hun Khim at&nbsp;[toh\_hun\_khim@acsbr.moe.edu.sg](mailto:toh_hun_khim@acsbr.moe.edu.sg)&nbsp;for any clarifications. Thank you.
