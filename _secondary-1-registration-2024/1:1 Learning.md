#### **Personal Learning Device (Chromebook) Purchase** #####

**Hardware**

----------------------------------------------------
Since 2016, students in the school have been using [chromebooks](https://www.google.com/chromebook/) for 1:1 Learning. From 2021, the school started leveraging the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) and MOE Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) to facilitate the chromebook personal learning device (PLD) procurement process. The school has evaluated the given options from a panel of awarded suppliers established by MOE and chosen the **Acer R756TN chromebook** for the 2024 Sec 1 cohort. The specifications of the chromebook are as follows:


•	Acer R756TN chromebook
* Intel Processor N200 
* 8 GB LPDDR5 RAM
* 64GB eMMC
* 11.6" HD (1366 x 768) Multi-Touch IPS LCD panel		
* Intel UHD Graphics
* 2x USB-C, 2x USB-A, 1x 3.5mm headphone jack		
* Intel Wifi 6E AX201 802.11abgn/acR2 & Bluetooth v5.1		
* Dual Cameras (display top & keyboard top)
* Google Chrome OS
* 3 year Carry-in Warranty + Comprehensive Accidental Damage Protection (Insurance)
* Weight: 1.35 kg
* Accessories include: Power Adaptor, Mouse, Stylus, Carrier Bag
    

In addition, the chromebook will be bundled with **3 years carry-in warranty and insurance** (2 major repairs or 1 replacement) to cover accidental damage to the chromebook device.

Total Cost with GST: **S$570.07**


**Software**


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Device Management Application (“DMA”) will come pre-installed on all chromebook PLDs purchased through the school, and will be installed on all student-owned devices subject to parental/guardian consent. 

The DMA has 3 main components which will support the use of the chromebook PLD in the classroom and safeguard students’ cyber wellness:
*  Classroom Management Service. This enables teachers to manage the students’ use of the PLD during lesson time to improve classroom management and support effective teaching and learning.
*  Mobile Device Management Service. This facilitates the updating and managing of the PLD, protects the PLD from malicious software, and protects students from objectionable internet content.
*  Usage Management Service. This enables the school and/or parents/guardians to better supervise and set helpful limits for students’ use of PLD after school.

Please note that the school currently has a Block All Except Whitelist policy in place for all our chromebook PLDs during school hours.


**Procurement**


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Singapore Citizens

Students who are Singaporean citizens are allowed to draw on their Edusave Pupils Fund (EPF) to procure the chromebook bundle. This will minimise the cash out-of-pocket for parents. A one-time EPF top-up of $200 has been provided to all Primary and Secondary students in Apr 2020. This is on top of the annual contribution of $290 for Secondary students. Parents/guardians can also choose to pay cash for the chromebook bundle.

Subsidies will be provided for MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) students and those from lower income families. Please note that it is compulsory for all existing students on the MOE FAS to use their Edusave to pay for the chromebook bundle, after subsidies have been granted.

To proceed with the purchase, please fill in the online form at this link: [**https://go.gov.sg/pdlpadmin**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.gov.sg%2Fpdlpadmin&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3VIflBwyK7tkU69jw0p6PB) (Singpass to access). The online form will consist:

*   Intent to Purchase. For parents/guardians to indicate intent to purchase PLD.
*   Use of Edusave (for Singapore Citizens only). For parents/guardians who have opted to use their child’s/ward’s Edusave to pay for the PLD bundle.
*   Collection of PLD (if purchasing). For parents/guardians to authorise their child/ward or an adult to collect the device on their behalf. You may appoint your child/ward to collect the PLD as the Vendor will run through a device checklist with the students at the point of collection to ensure that the device is in good working condition.
    

If you are unable to submit the form online, you can print the hardcopy version (**Annexes A to C** are appended below) and submit them to the school’s General Office.

  

Permanent Residents/International Students

Subsidies will be provided for students from lower income families.

Fill up hardcopy **Annex A: Intent to Purchase** form and submit to admin office.

Parents could submit the **Annex C: Authorisation** Form if you would like to appoint your child/ward to collect his/her device personally

**Annexes A, B and C - for parents/guardians without Singpass access**

**Payment**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each student would receive a personalised bill subsequently in Feb 2021.

For parents who have chose to pay by cash and are already on GIRO with MOE, the system will auto-deduct the charges from their GIRO account directly and they will not be required to pay cash or cheque.

For those parents who are not on GIRO, the school bill will indicate the outstanding amount which they will need to pay in either cash/cheque to the school or through AXS.

As far as possible, students are to keep to the stipulated date/timing for the ICT induction. In the event that students are unable to attend any stipulated session (due to Academic Coaching, CCA or whatever reason), they can join any session that are planned for other classes. Do email [it\_helpdesk@acsbr.org](mailto:it_helpdesk@acsbr.org) to inform them about the change. Students should bring their students' handbook and a pen for the induction. They do NOT need to bring their own computing devices. School laptops will be provided for the induction. Students from 1M do not need to stay back as their induction will be conducted during their CPA lessons.
