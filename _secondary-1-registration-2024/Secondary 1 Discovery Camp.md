#### **ACS (Barker Road) Outdoor Experiential Programme** ####


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In ACS (Barker Road), we believe in the holistic development of the individual through the school curriculum. Every ACS (Barker Road) student will undergo a progressive three-year Outdoor Experiential Programme from Secondary 1 to 3 which seeks to expose him to outdoor living, encourage independence, teamwork and resilience, and eventually develop his leadership potential. Outdoor Education capitalises on the learning opportunities afforded by an outdoor setting that are not possible in a classroom setting.

In the first year of the ACS (Barker Road) Outdoor Experiential Programme, all Secondary 1 students will undergo a 4D3N Discovery Camp where they will be exposed to outdoor elements and activities. In Secondary 3, they will further develop their ruggedness by undergoing a 5D4N expeditionary course at Outward Bound Singapore.

The ACS (Barker Road) Outdoor Experiential Programme is compulsory for every ACS (Barker Road) student.
