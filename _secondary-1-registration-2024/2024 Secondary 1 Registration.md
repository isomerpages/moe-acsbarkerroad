#### **Chromebooks (Personal Learning Devices)** ####
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The school has been on the 1:1 Learning (1 student to 1 computing device) programme since 2012 where ICT is closely integrated into the students’ core and co-curriculums. Within the academic domain, students use their computing devices for collaborating, research and creating artefacts of their learning. On the character front, students are also challenged to think about their values in making responsible decisions while using technology. Students in Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road) have been using chromebooks as their Personal Learning Device for 1:1 Learning since 2016 and the school will leverage on the MOE Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) to facilitate the chromebook procurement process. 

Your son is required to purchase a chromebook for 1:1 Learning. More details will be provided during the Meet-The-Parent session on 5 Jan. You can also refer to this [page](/admissions/2024-sec-1-registration/11learning/) and this [FAQ](https://go.gov.sg/acsbr-chromebook-faq) for more information.

1:1 Learning for the Sec 1s is scheduled to commence from Term 2 Week 2  and students should bring their chromebooks to school daily for their learning.

Once again, we want to welcome you to ACS (Barker Road) . The next few years will be a time of growing and development for our young men. It will be interesting and exciting as we see each become an ACS Gentleman, for we know that The Best Is Yet To Be!
