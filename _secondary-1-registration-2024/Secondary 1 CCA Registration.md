**CCA General Information**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) are a key component of the holistic development of our students. Through CCAs, our students discover their interests and talents. CCAs also help our students to learn values and develop their character, social emotional competencies and skills to prepare them for future challenges.

CCAs bring students from diverse backgrounds together. By learning and interacting with one another, students develop friendships and deepen their sense of belonging to the school and community. In ACS (Barker Road), diversity is increased through external CCA partnerships with other schools.

CCA is compulsory for all secondary school students. Students can choose from any of these 4 categories:

1.  Physical Sports
2.  Visual and Performing Arts Group
3.  Uniformed Group   
4.  Clubs and Societies
        

For more information on the different CCAs, please visit the ACSBR CCA Website: [Link](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsites.google.com%2Facsbr.org%2Fcca%2Fhome&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3xAa9CX91cjeX8OSwrSeMi)
