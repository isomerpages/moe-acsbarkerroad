<h3><strong>Family@Barker Parent Support Group (PSG)</strong></h3>
<p>Family@Barker (F@B) is a vibrant community of parent volunteers who work
closely with our school to enrich and support its programmes. Their goal
is to provide parents with meaningful opportunities to connect, share experiences,
and support one another throughout their sons’ secondary school journey,
as they grow into young adults and prepare for their national examinations.</p>
